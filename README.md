# WebDev-Project
This is a game store project that I've created for my university coursework.

The package used the following languages: HTML, CSS, PHP, mySQL, Javascript (jQuery, AJAX)

The project requirement was to create a system to allow employees and admins to login to the system. 
Displaying the appropriate options depending on login credentials

Admin options: add game, delete game, add stock to game, delete stock off game, add user + password.
User option: add game, delete game, add stock to game, delete stock off game.

There was minimal styling (apart from the login page) for the simplified use and faster displaying options.
